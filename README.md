# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns. I have added Colorize just for the fun of it.

## Design
* game: controls the flow of the game, manages turns, updates board
* board: stores the state, renders to console
* players: contains marker, name, and color

## Dependencies

* Colorize
